Development of Data Acquisition Tool using data and requirement analysis in the area of environmental qualifications. Respecting external customer requirements and specifications the data acquisition during environmental qualifications should be optimized to balance necessary data and data volume.
\begin{itemize}
    \item Study of existing data acquisition (DAQ) methods and models.
    \item Analysis of mathematical approaches to condense large data volumes without losing necessary content.
    \item Requirement analysis of Test specific DAQ methods
    \item Algorithm development for smart data acquisition
    \item Data Analysis for fine tuning DAQ process: Comparison of original (100\%) data and condensed data regarding information content.
\end{itemize}
